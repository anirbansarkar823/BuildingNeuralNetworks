#### This repo is on building Neural Networks from scratch.
    - A big shoutout to sentdex. I highly refered his videos for Scratch Implementation of neural networks forward pass.
    Highly recommended [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex/playlists)

    - Federated Learning using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Deep Learning)
        -	Target was to improve the privacy of data, FL was introduced where data never leaves the client's system, instead the model travels to clients machines, learns the weights and biases and aggregate them on server to build the final model
        -	Used Seoul's air pollution dataset, where each city was considered to be one client and applied FedAvg FL algorithm to find some comparative results.
        -	Observed that improving randomization in FL are giving good results, almost equivalent to tradition learning (where data and final model resides on same system)

    - Also worked on CNN on MNIST. Simple CNN architectural implementation to understand the working of kernel, strides, padding and polling.

    - Also worked on NLP using LSTM to understand RNN architectural design and working.

    - MLP to learn and understand the implementation various concepts like Batch Normalization to overcome internal variance shifts, dropout to overcome high-variance/over fitting, then use of different optimizers, kernel initializers and architectural design in ANN.

    - Have implemented the learnings of ANN on SONAR dataset to understand it, with and without dropout
